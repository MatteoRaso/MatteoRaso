# One of the Github profiles of all time

Whether you're a fan or a hater, there's no denying that this is one of the Github profiles of all time. Far and wide, people around the world have seen my Github profile and walked away thinking the same thing: "If you looked at all the Github profiles out there, you would have also looked at Matteo's Github profile." 

Here's what some people are saying about my repos:

>There is code.


>When Matteo told me that he had written computer code before, I didn't believe him. I mean, I only found out what a computer was 3 days ago, and now Matteo seriously wants me to believe that he can tell the tiny magic men inside this weird box what to do? It wasn't until he told the Google wizard to take us to his Github profile that I realized he could control the magic men. With an equal amount of shock and fear, I watched while Matteo showed me that he can write down instructions for these magic men to do for him, and that this website is for him to share this "code" with other "people". I don't know how much of that is true, but there's definitely code on this "website".


>Matteo is so passionate about Git, he actually founded Github to help other developers easily share their code. You might not believe me, but can you honestly say that you know who the founder of Github is? That's right, you can't, so you can't say that I'm lying. In fact, you probably don't know who the inventor of Git is, do you? If you don't, assume it was Matteo. If you do, that was just a joke.
